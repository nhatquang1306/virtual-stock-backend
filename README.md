Side project I did with 2 other Tech Elevator graduates.  
This is the backend code for a realistic stock market game built with Java, PostgreSQl, Spring Boot, RESTful API, and Vue.js. The platform lets users create and participate in stock trading games, trade stocks with simulated funds, access stock data from a public API, and compete in a leaderboard system. The site uses random number generator to simulate real-time stock price fluctuation. User authentication is implemented to ensure data security.  
The site is live at https://nhatquang1306.github.io/virtual-stock/
